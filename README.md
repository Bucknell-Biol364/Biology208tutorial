# Biology208tutorial

## Introduction
Using R is an important skill that Bucknell biology professors are beginning to incorporate in their courses. While typically touted as a "better way to make graphs," there are many benefits to learning R. This includes better dataset preparation and manipulation, data analyses for different types of data, and better data visualization.

## How to access and use this tutorial
Within this github repository ("folder") you will need to download two documents: "Biol_208_Tutorial.Rmd" and "BIO208_Demog_Calcs_Master.xlsx"

The first document is the R markdown which is the tutorial itself, and features introductory material, codes, and comments through out. The second document is an excel document that contains Demography Data from previous 208 courses that will be used in the R tutorial. Both of these documents should be saved on your computer in a known location

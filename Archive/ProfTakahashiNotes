The excel sheet contains the global warming survey data that the 208 students collected in 2015. There are 422 data points (see sheet 1). Prior to the survey, we as a class discussed what would be potential independent variables (respondent's properties) that would affect the answers to the two questions: 1) Global warming is happening and 2) Global warming is largely caused by human activities. I adopted those questions from Yale Climate Change Communication project (http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2018/) so that we can make a comparison with the national data. I ran simple stats ignoring data distribution which is on the sheet "Figs". We also discussed the importance of unbiased data collection via interview.

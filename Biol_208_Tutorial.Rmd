```{r setup, include=FALSE}
datasets::iris
?iris
head(iris)
summary(iris)
iris
```

1. General data work with iris (QHP):
  -data exploration: shaprio test, qqplot 
  -t-test
  -regression
  -bar graph vs. boxplot vs. piechart (boo)
2. shannon-diversity calculation
  -maybe a figure? (provide a simple data set- clean csv/excel file, a template of sorts)
3. survivorship/mortality work
  -figure

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
